# Catalan-Counted Combinatorial Structures in Python
## Capabilities so far:
1) Create create a uniform random random dyck path of 2n + 1 length 
2) Convert dyck path into a size n rooted plane tree with bijection (gluing the paths)
3) Convert dyck path into binary tree with n internal nodes with left correspondance bijection.

## Todo 
1) create non-crossing partitions from dyck path.
2) optimize implementations
3) Mathematica modeling.
4) Tree structures to graph mode
